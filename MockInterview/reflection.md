# Reflection: Mock Interview (STAR Technique)

## S – Situation
After completing theoretical training on interview preparation and techniques, I was required to participate in a **Mock Interview**. The task involved recording a video of myself answering a set of common interview questions, simulating a real job interview environment and professional scenario.

## T – Task
My task was to practically apply the interview skills I had learned, including professional verbal communication, appropriate body language, and the **STAR method** for structuring responses. I needed to present myself confidently and professionally, using a neutral background, a suitable appearance, and clear communication to create a strong first impression.

## A – Action
I selected six core interview questions, including *“Tell me about yourself,” “How do you handle stress?” “Highest level of education completed,” “Give an example of how you prioritise tasks,” “What does the future of the industry look like to you?”* and *“How would you describe yourself in one word?”*. Before recording, I rehearsed each response using the STAR technique to ensure clarity, relevance, and structure. During the recording, I maintained eye contact with the camera, ensured proper lighting, and used a neutral background. After completing the recording, I reviewed the video to evaluate my delivery, non-verbal communication, and speaking pace.

## R – Result
The completed Mock Interview video serves as concrete evidence of my practical interview readiness. Through self-review, I identified strengths in my structured responses, professional appearance, and overall confidence, as well as areas for improvement, such as minimising filler words and refining my delivery. This exercise demonstrated my ability to:

- Perform under pressure in a structured interview setting  
- Clearly and coherently articulate my qualifications and experiences  
- Maintain professional non-verbal communication standards  

This reflective practice significantly improved my confidence and confirmed my preparedness for real-world job interviews.
