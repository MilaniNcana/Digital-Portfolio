This assessment focused on essential professional behaviours, covering topics such as the appropriate handling of rude emails, punctuality for meetings, managing confidential information, using personal technology at work, and the protocol for requesting to leave work early. A final mark of 100/100 was achieved on this submitted formative assessment.

T - Task
The task was to demonstrate my preparedness to operate professionally within an organisational environment by applying sound judgment to various common workplace scenarios. I needed to showcase my understanding of professional decorum and best practices to ensure harmonious and efficient interactions with colleagues and management.

I specifically focused on procedures for handling difficult professional communication, like rude emails, and the general standard for using personal devices at my desk. During the assessment, I carefully considered each scenario, ensuring my chosen response aligned with professional and respectful etiquette. The final mark of 100% confirms that I successfully mastered all the core principles of workplace etiquette required by the training.

R - Result
The result is the successful completion of the formative assessment with a Final Mark of 100/100, submitted on 28/03/2025. This artefact is clear evidence of my proficiency in critical workplace behaviours. I have learned and demonstrated the capacity to:
