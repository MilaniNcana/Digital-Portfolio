## S – Situation
I was required to complete a formative assessment on **Workplace Etiquette** as the final component of the work readiness training program. The assessment focused on essential professional behaviours, including handling rude or inappropriate emails, punctuality for meetings, managing confidential information, appropriate use of personal technology at work, and the correct protocol for requesting to leave work early. The assessment was completed with a **Final Mark of 100/100**, submitted on **28/03/2025**.

## T – Task
My task was to demonstrate my readiness to operate professionally within an organisational environment by applying sound judgment to common workplace scenarios. This required showing an understanding of professional conduct, workplace policies, and respectful interaction with colleagues and management.

## A – Action
I studied the workplace etiquette training material in detail, focusing on expectations around punctuality, confidentiality, and professional communication. I paid particular attention to how to respond appropriately to difficult situations, such as receiving rude or offensive emails, and the responsible use of personal devices during working hours. During the assessment, I carefully evaluated each scenario and selected responses that aligned with professional standards and organisational best practices.

## R – Result
The assessment was successfully completed with a **Final Mark of 100/100**, providing clear evidence of my understanding of workplace etiquette. Through this process, I demonstrated the ability to:

- Handle rude or offensive emails in a professional and respectful manner  
- Recognise the importance of punctuality for scheduled meetings  
- Manage confidential information responsibly  
- Adhere to workplace rules regarding personal cell phone usage

This reflection confirms my readiness to integrate into a professional workplace environment and contribute positively to organisational culture.
