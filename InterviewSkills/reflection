# Reflection: Interview Skills (STAR Technique)

## S – Situation
I was required to complete a formative assessment on **Interview Skills** as part of a work readiness training program. The assessment focused on key aspects of the interview process, including the primary purpose of an interview, structured response techniques such as the **CAR (Context, Action, Result)** method, the importance of company research, and effective strategies for answering behavioural questions like *“Tell me about yourself”* and *“What is your greatest weakness?”*. The objective was to achieve a final mark of **100/100**.

## T – Task
My task was to demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of effective interview strategies by correctly answering all questions in the assessment. This required showing readiness to participate confidently and professionally in real-world interview scenarios, including preparation, response structure, and interview conduct.

## A – Action
I carefully reviewed the interview skills training material, focusing on practical preparation techniques. This included understanding how to apply the CAR method to competency-based questions, learning how to present weaknesses in a constructive and professional manner, and recognising the importance of researching a company before an interview. I approached the assessment systematically, analysing each question and selecting responses that aligned with best interview practices taught in the training.

## R – Result
The assessment was successfully completed with a **Final Mark of 100/100**. This result confirms my readiness to apply effective interview strategies in professional settings. I demonstrated the ability to:

- Clearly articulate the purpose of a job interview  
- Structure strong and relevant responses using methods such as CAR  
- Confidently introduce myself and respond to behavioural interview questions  
- Recognise company research as a critical part of interview preparation  

This reflection provides evidence of both knowledge acquisition and my ability to strategically prepare for and navigate professional job interviews.
