# Reflection: Business Communication (STAR Technique)

## S – Situation
I was required to complete a formative assessment on **Business Communication** as part of a work readiness training program. The assessment covered core concepts such as the primary purpose of business communication, non-verbal communication, appropriate use of formal and informal language, recommended email tone, and etiquette for virtual conferencing backgrounds. The objective was to achieve a perfect score of **100/100**.

## T – Task
My task was to apply the theoretical knowledge gained during the training to successfully complete the assessment. This required selecting responses that demonstrated a clear understanding of professional communication principles in various workplace scenarios.

## A – Action
I thoroughly reviewed the course material, focusing on how communication principles differ depending on context, such as formal versus informal language and written versus non-verbal communication. During the assessment, I carefully analysed each scenario and selected the most professionally appropriate response based on the training content. Although some individual Sharable Content Objects (SCOs) were initially marked as incorrect, I used the feedback provided by the assessment structure to reassess and correct my responses. This iterative approach allowed me to refine my understanding and ensure all learning outcomes were met.

## R – Result
The assessment was successfully completed with a **Final Mark of 100/100**, submitted on **07/03/2025**. This outcome demonstrates my solid understanding of essential business communication skills, including:

- Understanding the primary purpose of business communication  
- Identifying key elements of non-verbal communication  
- Knowing when to use formal language in professional settings  
- Applying the appropriate tone in business email communication  
- Adhering to recommended etiquette for virtual meeting backgrounds  

The self-correction process reinforced my ability to reflect, adapt, and apply professional communication standards, confirming my readiness to operate effectively in workplace communication environments.
